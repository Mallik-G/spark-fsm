For marketeers it is very useful to determine which \r\nitem is bought one after another, and to predict from that which item will be probably bought next.\r\n\r\n**Sequences from Web Sessions**\r\n\r\nIn the context of web mining, especially web usage mining, companies need to understand what motivates their customers to purchase \r\nand how to influence the buying process to develop successful promotional activities.\r\n\r\nEvaluating web sessions and the timely ordered sequences of page visits (within a certain time period), e.g. helps to understand \r\nsimilarities of click-streams much better than treating sessions as sets of page visits. As a results, visitors can be clustered \r\nor segmented not only by visited content, but also by their timely behavior and signatures.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
