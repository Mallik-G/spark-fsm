<p>Sequential pattern mining is an important mining technique with a wide range of real-life applications.
It has been found very useful in domains such as </p>

<ul>
<li>market basket analysis</li>
<li>marketing strategy </li>
<li>medical treatment</li>
<li>natural disaster</li>
<li>user behavior analysis</li>
</ul><p>and more.</p>

<p>It is an extension to the concept of association rule mining and solves the problem of discovering statistically 
relevant patterns in big datasets that specify (timely ordered) sequences of data.</p>

<p><strong>Sequences from Transactions</strong></p>

<p>In market basket analysis, a sequence is a list of different transactions of a certain customer, ordered by the transaction time. 
Each transaction is a collection of the items a particular customer ordered. For marketeers it is very useful to determine which 
item is bought one after another, and to predict from that which item will be probably bought next.</p>

<p><strong>Sequences from Web Sessions</strong></p>

<p>In the context of web mining, especially web usage mining, companies need to understand what motivates their customers to purchase 
and how to influence the buying process to develop successful promotional activities.</p>

<p>Evaluating web sessions and the timely ordered sequences of page visits (within a certain time period), e.g. helps to understand 
similarities of click-streams much better than treating sessions as sets of page visits. As a results, visitors can be clustered 
or segmented not only by visited content, but also by their timely behavior and signatures.</p>
